        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello to whom it may concern,  my name is shaan chowdhury and I am a 19 year old college student. Currently I am a freshman at UCR with a major in sociology. I am currently studying sociology with the goal of being a K9 police officer. I plan on going to the police academy and to do this I am taking the steps to get as much knowledge as possible until I am 21 years old and can join the police academy. My current professional experiences are when I worked at a mexican restaurant for about a year and a half. At this restaurant I learned how to manage and deal with all types of people. There were several moments where customers would be rude and disrespectful which has definitely prepared and taught me how to manage these things better. At the restaurant it would get very busy pretty quickly which has taught me how to deal with getting things done without angering the people and still providing the best service. Having these experiences working at the restaurant have definitely better prepared me for my future career and have helped me mature a lot.<br><br>

        During high school I was a part of many different clubs and activities as well as advanced classes like many I.B and AP courses that as well prepared me for my future. An example of this is being a part of the united student league and being the president of this club. To do this you definitely need to have the leadership skills and be making decisions that affect the school. As time progressed, I became great at leading and making quick decisions, this helped prepare me for my future goal. One of my greatest skills I personally would say I have is being a leader, I constantly try to lead the way and make sure everything is in order.On top of my leadership skills i am also very active and i was also the captain of the schools Golf team and Co-Captain of the football team which has also helped me Build my skills at being a great leader and Working against the clock.<br><br>

        Additionally I am in the process of joining the riverside sheriff's department as a correctional officer. I plan on doing this in  order to get more experience in the law enforcement field. By joining this academy I will be able to get a better understanding on what the police academy will really be like and I can have that knowledge. With this experience I will be able to gain connections with people who want to follow a similar path as me. As well as making connections with friends I will be able to meet police officers, sheriffs, and other officers in the law enforcement field that can be mentors to me and people I can go to with questions about being in the law enforcement field. Personally I would like to get into this job field because I hope to make a difference in the community and with the goal of being a police officer that people would want to go up to and would even one day look up to
